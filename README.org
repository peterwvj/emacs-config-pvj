* About this repository

I have developed a set of configuration files that allow me to
efficiently carry out my daily work in Emacs. This repository contains
these configuration files in the hope that they will be useful to
others. To synchronise emails I use OfflineIMAP. I keep my OfflineIMAP
configuration files in one of my other [[https://github.com/peterwvj/offlineimap-config-pvj/][repositories]].

* Repository structure

The Emacs initialisation file, =.emacs=, is located in the root of the
repository. It loads several other features from the =elisp=
folder. As an example, =elisp/mu4e-config.el= contains my [[http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]] (email
client) configuration.

* Configuration highlights

The configuration files are used to:

- Manage multiple email accounts using mu4e
- Work with LaTeX using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/][AUCTeX]] and [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools][pdf-tools]]
- Manage Git repositories
- Manage calendars
- Etc.

* Using the configuration

Comprehensive Emacs configuration usually take a bit of time to
load. To address this, I launch an Emacs daemon on system startup:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
emacs --daemon
#+END_SRC

In addition, I define a function =e= that I use to launch Emacs or
open files with Emacs from the terminal:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
function e {
  emacsclient -c -a emacs "$@" > /dev/null 2>&1 & disown
}
#+END_SRC

So for example, in order to open a =file= one simply types:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
e file
#+END_SRC

By launching Emacs as a client you don't have to wait for the
configuration to load every time you need to use Emacs.

* Screenshots

Below are some examples of how Emacs looks when the configuration is
loaded.
