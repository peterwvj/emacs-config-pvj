* About this repository

I have developed a set of configuration files that allow me to carry
out my daily work in Emacs efficiently. This repository contains these
configuration files in the hope that they will be useful to others.

* Repository structure

The Emacs initialisation file, =.emacs=, is located in the root of the
repository. It loads several other features from the =elisp=
folder. As an example, =elisp/mu4e-config.el= contains my =mu4e=
(email cient) configuration.

* Configuration highlights

The configuration files are used to:

- Manage multiple email accounts using [[http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]]
- Work with LaTeX using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/][AUCTeX]] and [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools][pdf-tools]]
- Manage Git repositories
- Manage calendars
- Etc.
