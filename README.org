* About this repository

I have developed a set of configuration files that allow me to
efficiently carry out my daily work in Emacs. This repository contains
these configuration files in the hope that they will be useful to
others. To synchronise emails I use OfflineIMAP. I keep my OfflineIMAP
configuration files in one of my other [[https://github.com/peterwvj/offlineimap-config-pvj/][repositories]].

* Repository structure

The Emacs initialisation file, =.emacs=, is located in the root of the
repository. It loads several other features from the =elisp=
folder. As an example, =elisp/mu4e-config.el= contains my [[http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]] (email
client) configuration.

* Configuration highlights

The configuration files are used to:

- Manage multiple email accounts using mu4e
- Work with LaTeX using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/][AUCTeX]] and [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools][pdf-tools]]
- Manage Git repositories
- Manage calendars
- Etc.

* Using the configuration

Comprehensive Emacs configurations usually take a bit of time to
load. To address this, I launch Emacs as a /daemon/ on system startup,
and every time I need to use Emacs I launch it as a /client/. In this
way, the configuration only needs to be loaded once during system
startup.

To launch Emacs as a daemon execute:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
emacs --daemon
#+END_SRC

In addition, I use a function =e= to launch Emacs as a client:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
function e {
  emacsclient -c -a emacs "$@" > /dev/null 2>&1 & disown
}
#+END_SRC

Now, to open a file with Emacs you simply run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
e <file>
#+END_SRC

* Screenshots

Below are some examples of how Emacs looks when the configuration is
loaded.
