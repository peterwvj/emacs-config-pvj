* About this repository

I have developed a set of configuration files that allow me to
efficiently carry out my daily work in Emacs. This repository contains
these configuration files in the hope that they will be useful to
others. To synchronise emails I use OfflineIMAP. I keep my OfflineIMAP
configuration files in one of my other [[https://github.com/peterwvj/offlineimap-config-pvj/][repositories]].

* Repository structure

The Emacs initialisation file, =.emacs=, is located in the root of the
repository. It loads several other features from the =elisp=
folder. As an example, =elisp/mu4e-config.el= contains my =mu4e=
(email cient) configuration.

* Configuration highlights

The configuration files are used to:

- Manage multiple email accounts using [[http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]]
- Work with LaTeX using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/][AUCTeX]] and [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools][pdf-tools]]
- Manage Git repositories
- Manage calendars
- Etc.

* Screenshots

Below are some examples of how Emacs looks when the configuration is
loaded.
